Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) - Operates as RBC Bank in the U.S., offering cross-border banking services tailored for Canadians and maintaining a network of ATMs and branches, particularly focused on wealth management and capital markets.

Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) - Known as TD Bank, America‚Äôs Most Convenient Bank, it‚Äôs one of the largest Canadian banks in the U.S., with extensive retail banking operations, especially along the East Coast, stemming from its Canadian parent, Toronto-Dominion Bank.

Bank of Montreal (BMO) - Operates in the U.S. as BMO Harris Bank, providing commercial and retail banking services, with a strong presence in the Midwest, particularly Illinois.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) - Through CIBC Bank USA, it focuses on commercial banking and wealth management, with a smaller retail footprint compared to others, mainly serving cross-border clients.

Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) - Known as Scotiabank in the U.S., it has a more limited direct retail presence but operates through subsidiaries and focuses on corporate and investment banking.

These banks are part of Canada‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù and have expanded into the U.S. to serve both Canadian clients with cross-border needs and American customers.

Here are the primary Canadian banks that operate in the US as of March 04, 2025:

1. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) - RBC operates in the US through RBC Bank, based in Georgia, focusing on cross-border banking for Canadians living, working, or traveling in the US. It provides checking accounts, mortgages, and credit cards, with access to over 50,000 no-fee ATMs across all 50 states via partnerships like Allpoint. RBC also has a significant presence in wealth management and capital markets through subsidiaries like RBC Wealth Management and RBC Capital Markets.

2. Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) - Known as TD Bank, N.A. in the US, it‚Äôs one of the largest foreign banks in the country, with over 1,100 branches primarily along the East Coast from Maine to Florida. It offers retail banking (checking, savings, mortgages), commercial banking, and wealth management services, leveraging its acquisition of Canada Trust and subsequent US expansions.

3. Bank of Montreal (BMO) - BMO operates in the US as BMO Harris Bank, headquartered in Chicago, with over 600 branches across states like Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and California. Following its 2023 acquisition of Bank of the West, BMO has expanded its footprint significantly, offering retail banking, commercial lending, and wealth management, positioning itself as a major North American bank.

4. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) - CIBC operates in the US through CIBC Bank USA, also based in Chicago, with a focus on commercial banking, wealth management, and personal banking for clients with North American operations. It has a limited retail presence, with branches mostly in Illinois, but offers tailored cross-border services for Canadians.

5. Scotiabank (Bank of Nova Scotia) - Scotiabank has a presence in the US primarily through wholesale banking and capital markets, rather than widespread retail operations. It serves corporate and institutional clients, with some retail offerings in specific regions like Florida via partnerships or subsidiaries, though its US footprint is smaller compared to the others.

6. National Bank of Canada - Its US operations are more limited, mainly through its subsidiary Natbank (National Bank of Canada, N.A.), which operates in Florida. It focuses on retail banking and services for Canadians in the US, such as snowbirds, with a smaller scale compared to the ""Big Five"" banks.

These banks are part of Canada‚Äôs ""Big Five"" (RBC, TD, BMO, CIBC, Scotiabank), with National Bank often considered a significant but smaller player. Their US operations cater to both Canadian expatriates and American clients, often emphasizing cross-border convenience, such as free transfers between Canadian and US accounts or using Canadian credit history for US services. Each bank‚Äôs scale and focus in the US vary, with TD and BMO having the most extensive retail networks, while others prioritize commercial or niche markets.",en,['libsoftiktok'],1.52E+18,TheRealUltraMKB,1.90E+18,1.33E+18,libsoftiktok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are the major Canadian banks that do business in America as of March 4, 2025:

1. **Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)**  
   - **Presence in the U.S.:** RBC operates through its subsidiary, RBC Bank, and has a significant footprint via its wealth management and capital markets divisions. Its U.S.-based retail banking arm, City National Bank, operates around 70 branches across 10 states, primarily serving high-net-worth individuals and businesses. RBC Capital Markets also has a strong presence in the U.S., providing investment and corporate banking services.
   - **Services:** Personal and commercial banking, wealth management, insurance, and investment banking.

2. **Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)**  
   - **Presence in the U.S.:** TD Bank, branded as ""America‚Äôs Most Convenient Bank,"" is one of the largest Canadian banks in the U.S., with over 1,100 branches along the East Coast, from Maine to Florida. It‚Äôs a major player in retail banking, stemming from its acquisition of Commerce Bancorp and merger with TD Banknorth.
   - **Services:** Retail banking (e.g., TD Convenience Checking), mortgages, personal loans, and small business banking. No-fee ATM access is available through a large network.

3. **Bank of Montreal (BMO)**  
   - **Presence in the U.S.:** BMO operates as BMO Harris Bank in the U.S., with over 600 branches spread across states like Illinois, Wisconsin, and extending to the Pacific Coast and Florida. Its acquisition of Bank of the West in 2023 expanded its U.S. presence significantly, making it a North American-focused bank with nearly half its revenue from the U.S.
   - **Services:** Personal and commercial banking, wealth management, and capital markets. BMO offers no-fee ATM access via the Allpoint network in all 50 states.

4. **Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)**  
   - **Presence in the U.S.:** CIBC Bank USA has a more limited physical presence, with around 24 branches concentrated in the Midwest (especially Illinois), plus locations in California and Florida. It caters primarily to Canadians needing U.S. banking services and businesses with cross-border needs.
   - **Services:** Personal accounts (e.g., CIBC Bank USA Smart Account), commercial banking, and mortgages. It integrates with Canadian CIBC accounts for seamless cross-border banking.

5. **Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank)**  
   - **Presence in the U.S.:** Unlike the others, Scotiabank does not have a significant retail banking presence in the U.S. It focuses on capital markets and corporate banking through its U.S. operations, with no widespread branch network. However, Canadian Scotiabank customers can access Bank of America ATMs fee-free in 39 states via the Global ATM Alliance.
   - **Services:** Corporate and investment banking, trade finance, and limited retail options via partnerships.

These banks leverage their Canadian roots to serve both Canadian expatriates and U.S. customers, often focusing on regions with high Canadian traffic or economic ties.
